# Frontend Mentor - Single Price Grid Component

This was really enjoyable and helped me understand CSS grid a bit more. I am too used to flexbox for everything, this was a nice change of pace. I had some trouble accomplishing certain things, would love feedback on whether what I did to achieve this was best practice or not.

## My process:

- Desktop first Workflow
- Responsive Design
- Flexbox
- Grid

## What I learned:

Learned that you can use negative values for things like margin and got a lot more comfortable using CSS grid. Looking forward to tougher grid challenges.
